# To Do List- A React App

A simple To-Do List application built using React, deployed on Vercel. This application demonstrates a sleek and responsive design, where users can manage their daily tasks, add new ones, edit existing ones, and remove completed tasks with ease.

## Key React Features

**Task Management:** Users can add, delete, and mark tasks as complete. This core functionality is designed to provide a seamless experience in managing daily activities. <br>
**State Management:** Utilizes React state and context to manage and share state across components, demonstrating an understanding of advanced React patterns. <br>
**Local Storage Integration:** Tasks are kept between sessions using the browser's local storage, illustrating the ability to work with web storage APIs to enhance user experience. <br>
