# To Do List- A React App

A simple To-Do List application built using React, deployed on Vercel. This application has a sleek and responsive design, where users can manage their daily tasks, add new ones, edit existing ones, and remove completed tasks with ease.
<br>
## Key React Features

**Task Management:** Users can add, delete, and mark tasks as complete to provide a seamless experience in managing daily activities. <br>

**State Management:** Utilizes React state and context to manage and share state across components. <br>

**Local Storage Integration:** Tasks are kept between sessions using the browser's local storage. <br>
